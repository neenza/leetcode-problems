The order you visit the rooms for the coming days is determined by the following rules and a given 0-indexed array nextVisit of length n:\nReturn the label of the first day where you have been in all the rooms. It can be shown that such a day exists. Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo 109 + 7.\nExample 1:\nExample 2:\nExample 3:\nConstraints:",
