  "description": "There are two types of persons:\nYou are given a 0-indexed 2D integer array statements of size n x n that represents the statements made by n people about each other. More specifically, statements[i][j] could be one of the following:\nAdditionally, no person ever makes a statement about themselves. Formally, we have that statements[i][i] = 2 for all 0 <= i < n.\nReturn the maximum number of people who can be good based on the statements made by the n people.\nExample 1:\nExample 2:\nConstraints:",

There will be a contradiction in this case and this assumption is invalid.\n        - lying. In this case, person 0 is also a bad person and lied in their statement.\n    - Following that person 2 is a good person, there will be only one good person in the group.\n- Assuming that person 2 is a bad person:\n    - Based on the statement made by person 2, and since person 2 is bad, they could be:\n        - telling the truth. Following this scenario, person 0 and 1 are both bad as explained before.\n            - Following that person 2 is bad but told the truth, there will be no good persons in the group.\n        - lying. In this case person 1 is a good person.\n            - Since person 1 is a good person, person 0 is also a good person.\n            - Following that person 2 is bad and lied, there will be two good persons in the group.\nWe can see that at most 2 persons are good in the best case, so we return 2.\nNote that there is more than one way to arrive at this conclusion.",
