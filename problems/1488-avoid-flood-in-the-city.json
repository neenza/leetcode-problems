  "description": "Your country has an infinite number of lakes. Initially, all the lakes are empty, but when it rains over the nth lake, the nth lake becomes full of water. If it rains over a lake that is full of water, there will be a flood. Your goal is to avoid floods in any lake.\nGiven an integer array rains where:\nReturn an array ans where:\nIf there are multiple valid answers return any of them. If it is impossible to avoid flood return an empty array.\nNotice that if you chose to dry a full lake, it becomes empty, but if you chose to dry an empty lake, nothing changes.\nExample 1:\nExample 2:\nExample 3:\nConstraints:",
