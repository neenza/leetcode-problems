  "description": "You are given a floating-point number hour, representing the amount of time you have to reach the office. To commute to the office, you must take n trains in sequential order. You are also given an integer array dist of length n, where dist[i] describes the distance (in kilometers) of the ith train ride.\nEach train can only depart at an integer hour, so you may need to wait in between each train ride.\nReturn the minimum positive integer speed (in kilometers per hour) that all the trains must travel at for you to reach the office on time, or -1 if it is impossible to be on time.\nTests are generated such that the answer will not exceed 107 and hour will have at most two digits after the decimal point.\nExample 1:\nExample 2:\nExample 3:\nConstraints:",

The second train takes 3/1 = 3 hours.\n- Since we are already at an integer hour, we depart immediately at the 4 hour mark.
