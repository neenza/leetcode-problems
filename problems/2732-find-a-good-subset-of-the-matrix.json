  "description": "You are given a 0-indexed m x n binary matrix grid.\nLet us call a non-empty subset of rows good if the sum of each column of the subset is at most half of the length of the subset.\nMore formally, if the length of the chosen subset of rows is k, then the sum of each column should be at most floor(k / 2).\nReturn an integer array that contains row indices of a good subset sorted in ascending order.\nIf there are multiple good subsets, you can return any of them. If there are no good subsets, return an empty array.\nA subset of rows of the matrix grid is any matrix that can be obtained by deleting some (possibly none or all) rows from grid.\nExample 1:\nExample 2:\nExample 3:\nConstraints:",
