In the solution below, we'll focus on finding all subsequences (including empty ones), and subtract the empty subsequence at the end.\n\nLet's try for a dynamic programming solution.  In order to not repeat work, our goal is to phrase the current problem in terms of the answer to previous problems.  A typical idea will be to try to count the number of states `dp[k]` (distinct subsequences) that use letters `S[0], S[1], ..., S[k]`.\n\nNaively, for say, `S = \"abcx\"`, we have `dp[k] = dp[k-1] * 2`.  This is because for `dp[2]` which counts `(\"\", \"a\", \"b\", \"c\", \"ab\", \"ac\", \"bc\", \"abc\")`, `dp[3]` counts all of those, plus all of those with the `x` ending, like `(\"x\", \"ax\", \"bx\", \"cx\", \"abx\", \"acx\", \"bcx\", \"abcx\")`. Here's a visualization for this string.However, for something like `S = \"abab\"`, let's play around with it.  We have:\n\n* `dp[0] = 2`, as it counts `(\"\", \"a\")`\n* `dp[1] = 4`, as it counts `(\"\", \"a\", \"b\", \"ab\")`;\n* `dp[2] = 7` as it counts `(\"\", \"a\", \"b\", \"aa\", \"ab\", \"ba\", \"aba\")`;\n* `dp[3] = 12`, as it counts `(\"\", \"a\", \"b\", \"aa\", \"ab\", \"ba\", \"bb\", \"aab\", \"aba\", \"abb\", \"bab\", \"abab\")`.\n\nWe have that dp[3]` counts `dp[2]`, plus `(\"b\", \"aa\", \"ab\", \"ba\", \"aba\")` with `\"b\"` added to it.  Notice that `(\"\", \"a\")` are missing from this list, as they get double counted.  In general, the sequences that resulted from putting `\"b\"` the last time (ie. `\"b\", \"ab\"`) will get double counted. Here's a visualization for a string with repeated letters.This insight leads to the recurrence:\n\n`dp[k] = 2 * dp[k-1] - dp[last[S[k]]]`\n\nThe number of distinct subsequences ending at `S[k]`, is twice the distinct subsequences counted by `dp[k-1]` (all of them, plus all of them with S[k] appended), minus the amount we double counted, which is `dp[last[S[k]]]`.**Complexity Analysis**\n\n* Time Complexity:  $$O(N)$$, where $$N$$ is the length of `S`.\n\n* Space Complexity:  $$O(N)$$.  It is possible to adapt this solution to take $$O(1)$$ space."
