  "description": "Given an integer array nums and a positive integer k, return the most competitive subsequence of nums of size k.\nAn array's subsequence is a resulting sequence obtained by erasing some (possibly zero) elements from the array.\nWe define that a subsequence a is more competitive than a subsequence b (of the same length) if in the first position where a and b differ, subsequence a has a number less than the corresponding number in b. For example, [1,3,4] is more competitive than [1,3,5] because the first position they differ is at the final number, and 4 is less than 5.\nExample 1:\nExample 2:\nConstraints:",
