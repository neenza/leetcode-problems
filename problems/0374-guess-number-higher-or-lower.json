  "description": "We are playing the Guess Game. The game is as follows:\nI pick a number from 1 to n. You have to guess which number I picked.\nEvery time you guess wrong, I will tell you whether the number I picked is higher or lower than your guess.\nYou call a pre-defined API int guess(int num), which returns three possible results:\nReturn the number that I picked.\nExample 1:\nExample 2:\nExample 3:\nConstraints:",
