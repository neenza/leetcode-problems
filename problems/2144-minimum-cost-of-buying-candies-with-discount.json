  "description": "A shop is selling candies at a discount. For every two candies sold, the shop gives a third candy for free.\nThe customer can choose any candy to take away for free as long as the cost of the chosen candy is less than or equal to the minimum cost of the two candies bought.\nGiven a 0-indexed integer array cost, where cost[i] denotes the cost of the ith candy, return the minimum cost of buying all the candies.\nExample 1:\nExample 2:\nExample 3:\nConstraints:",

This is the only way we can buy the candies.\nNote that we cannot buy candies with costs 1 and 3, and then take the candy with cost 2 for free.\nThe cost of the free candy has to be less than or equal to the minimum cost of the purchased candies.",
