  "description": "You are given an integer array heights representing the heights of buildings, some bricks, and some ladders.\nYou start your journey from building 0 and move to the next building by possibly using bricks or ladders.\nWhile moving from building i to building i+1 (0-indexed),\nReturn the furthest building index (0-indexed) you can reach if you use the given ladders and bricks optimally.\nExample 1:\nExample 2:\nExample 3:\nConstraints:",

You must use either bricks or ladders because 2 < 7.\n- Go to building 3 without using ladders nor bricks since 7 >= 6.\n- Go to building 4 using your only ladder. You must use either bricks or ladders because 6 < 9.\nIt is impossible to go beyond building 4 because you do not have any more bricks or ladders.",
