  "description": "You are given a 0-indexed string hamsters where hamsters[i] is either:\nYou will add some number of food buckets at the empty indices in order to feed the hamsters. A hamster can be fed if there is at least one food bucket to its left or to its right. More formally, a hamster at index i can be fed if you place a food bucket at index i - 1 and/or at index i + 1.\nReturn the minimum number of food buckets you should place at empty indices to feed all the hamsters or -1 if it is impossible to feed all of them.\nExample 1:\nExample 2:\nExample 3:\nConstraints:",
