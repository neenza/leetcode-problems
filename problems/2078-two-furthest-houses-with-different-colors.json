  "description": "There are n houses evenly lined up on the street, and each house is beautifully painted. You are given a 0-indexed integer array colors of length n, where colors[i] represents the color of the ith house.\nReturn the maximum distance between two houses with different colors.\nThe distance between the ith and jth houses is abs(i - j), where abs(x) is the absolute value of x.\nExample 1:\nExample 2:\nExample 3:\nConstraints:",
