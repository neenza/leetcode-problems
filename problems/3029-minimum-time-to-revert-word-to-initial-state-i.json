  "description": "You are given a 0-indexed string word and an integer k.\nAt every second, you must perform the following operations:\nNote that you do not necessarily need to add the same characters that you removed. However, you must perform both operations at every second.\nReturn the minimum time greater than zero required for word to revert to its initial state.\nExample 1:\nExample 2:\nExample 3:\nConstraints:",

Thus, word becomes equal to \"cababac\".\nAt the 2nd second, we remove characters \"cab\" from the prefix of word, and add \"aba\" to the end of word. Thus, word becomes equal to \"abacaba\" and reverts to its initial state.\nIt can be shown that 2 seconds is the minimum time greater than zero required for word to revert to its initial state.",
