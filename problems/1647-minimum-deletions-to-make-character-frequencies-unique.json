  "description": "A string s is called good if there are no two different characters in s that have the same frequency.\nGiven a string s, return the minimum number of characters you need to delete to make s good.\nThe frequency of a character in a string is the number of times it appears in the string. For example, in the string \"aab\", the frequency of 'a' is 2, while the frequency of 'b' is 1.\nExample 1:\nExample 2:\nExample 3:\nConstraints:",
