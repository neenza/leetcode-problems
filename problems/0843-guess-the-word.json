  "description": "You are given an array of unique strings words where words[i] is six letters long. One word of words was chosen as a secret word.\nYou are also given the helper object Master. You may call Master.guess(word) where word is a six-letter-long string, and it must be from words. Master.guess(word) returns:\nThere is a parameter allowedGuesses for each test case where allowedGuesses is the maximum number of times you can call Master.guess(word).\nFor each test case, you should call Master.guess with the secret word without exceeding the maximum number of allowed guesses. You will get:\nThe test cases are generated such that you can guess the secret word with a reasonable strategy (other than using the bruteforce method).\nExample 1:\nExample 2:\nConstraints:",
