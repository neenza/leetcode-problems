  "description": "You are given two integers n and k and two integer arrays speed and efficiency both of length n. There are n engineers numbered from 1 to n. speed[i] and efficiency[i] represent the speed and efficiency of the ith engineer respectively.\nChoose at most k different engineers out of the n engineers to form a team with the maximum performance.\nThe performance of a team is the sum of its engineers' speeds multiplied by the minimum efficiency among its engineers.\nReturn the maximum performance of this team. Since the answer can be a huge number, return it modulo 109 + 7.\nExample 1:\nExample 2:\nExample 3:\nConstraints:",
