  "description": "You are given a string s that contains digits 0-9, addition symbols '+', and multiplication symbols '*' only, representing a valid math expression of single digit numbers (e.g., 3+5*2). This expression was given to n elementary school students. The students were instructed to get the answer of the expression by following this order of operations:\nYou are given an integer array answers of length n, which are the submitted answers of the students in no particular order. You are asked to grade the answers, by following these rules:\nReturn the sum of the points of the students.\nExample 1:\nExample 2:\nExample 3:\nConstraints:",

Therefore one student is rewarded 2 points: [20,13,42]\nThe points for the students are: [2,5,0]. The sum of the points is 2+5+0=7.",
