  "description": "You are given a 0-indexed array nums consisting of non-negative powers of 2, and an integer target.\nIn one operation, you must apply the following changes to the array:\nReturn the minimum number of operations you need to perform so that nums contains a subsequence whose elements sum to target. If it is impossible to obtain such a subsequence, return -1.\nA subsequence is an array that can be derived from another array by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.\nExample 1:\nExample 2:\nExample 3:\nConstraints:",
