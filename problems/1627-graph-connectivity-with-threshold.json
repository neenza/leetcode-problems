  "description": "We have n cities labeled from 1 to n. Two different cities with labels x and y are directly connected by a bidirectional road if and only if x and y share a common divisor strictly greater than some threshold. More formally, cities with labels x and y have a road between them if there exists an integer z such that all of the following are true:\nGiven the two integers, n and threshold, and an array of queries, you must determine for each queries[i] = [ai, bi] if cities ai and bi are connected directly or indirectly.Â (i.e. there is some path between them).\nReturn an array answer, where answer.length == queries.length and answer[i] is true if for the ith query, there is a path between ai and bi, or answer[i] is false if there is no path.\nExample 1:\nExample 2:\nExample 3:\nConstraints:",

However, since the threshold is 0,\nall divisors can be used. Since all numbers share 1 as a divisor, all cities are connected.",
