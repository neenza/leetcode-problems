  "description": "You are given a tree (i.e. a connected, undirected graph that has no cycles) rooted at node 0 consisting of n nodes numbered from 0 to n - 1. The tree is represented by a 0-indexed array parent of size n, where parent[i] is the parent of node i. Since node 0 is the root, parent[0] == -1.\nYou are also given a string s of length n, where s[i] is the character assigned to node i.\nReturn the length of the longest path in the tree such that no pair of adjacent nodes on the path have the same character assigned to them.\nExample 1:\nExample 2:\nConstraints:",

The length of this path is 3, so 3 is returned.\nIt can be proven that there is no longer path that satisfies the conditions.",
