  "description": "There is a directed graph consisting of n nodes numbered from 0 to n - 1 and n directed edges.\nYou are given a 0-indexed array edges where edges[i] indicates that there is an edge from node i to node edges[i].\nConsider the following process on the graph:\nReturn an array answer where answer[i] is the number of different nodes that you will visit if you perform the process starting from node i.\nExample 1:\nExample 2:\nConstraints:",

The number of different nodes we visit is 3.\n- Starting from node 1, we visit the nodes 1 -> 2 -> 0 -> 1. The number of different nodes we visit is 3.\n- Starting from node 2, we visit the nodes 2 -> 0 -> 1 -> 2. The number of different nodes we visit is 3.\n- Starting from node 3, we visit the nodes 3 -> 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 0. The number of different nodes we visit is 4.",
