Let's say we place a node with value `i` as the root node and place `i - 1` nodes having values from `1` to `i - 1` in the left subtree. (If `i == 1`, the left child is null). Similarly, we place the remaining `n - i` nodes having values from `i + 1` to `n` in the right subtree. (If `i == n`, the right child is null).\n\nNow, we create a list of nodes called `leftSubTrees` for all the possible BSTs that could be the left subtree. Similarly, we create a list of nodes called `rightSubTrees` for all the BSTs that could be the right subtree. \n\n> In a BST, every subtree is also a BST.\n\nWe iterate over both the lists and for each node pair `l` in `leftSubTrees` and `r` in `rightSubTrees`, we create a new `root` node with value `i` and set the left and right child of `root` to `l` and `r` respectively to form all the BSTs with the root node as `i`.\n\nWe can iterate over the root's value from `i = 1` to `n` and repeat the process for each root value to get all the BSTs.\n\nYou may notice that the subproblem of finding the arrays `leftSubTrees` and `rightSubTrees` are similar to the original problem. We can implement this approach using recursion as we are breaking down a problem with `n` nodes to smaller, repetitive subproblems with `i - 1` and `n - i` nodes (for `i = 1` till `n`) to compute the answer for `n` nodes. We only need the range of node values as the parameters to create the BSTs with nodes having values in that range.\n\nWe implement a recursive function `allPossibleBST(start, end)` where `start` and `end` correspond to the range of node values that should be present in the BSTs created by this call. For a root node with value `i`, we will find all the left subtrees using `leftSubTrees = allPossibleBST(start, i - 1)` and also compute all the right subtrees using `rightSubTrees = allPossibleBST(i + 1, right)`. Finally, we iterate over all pairs between `leftSubTrees` and `rightSubTrees` and create a new root with value `i` for each pair.\n\nThe base case of this function is when `start > end`. We have no values in our range and thus we will return `null` (an empty tree).\n\nHere is a visual representation of the recursion tree with `3` nodes:\n\n![img](../Figures/95/95-1.png)\n\nSeveral subproblems, such as `allPossibleBST(1, 1)`, `allPossibleBST(3, 3)`, etc., are solved multiple times in the small partial recursion tree shown above. If we draw the entire recursion tree, we can see that there are many subproblems that are solved repeatedly.\n\nTo avoid this issue, we store the solution of the subproblem in a hashmap that stores the mapping from a range of nodes values to the list of root nodes of all possible BSTs that can be formed with the same number of nodes. When we encounter the same subproblem again, we simply refer to this map to get the required list of `TreeNode`. This is called **memoization**.\n\n#### Algorithm\n\n1. Create a hash map `memo` where `memo[(start, end)]` contains the list of root nodes of all possible BSTs with the range of node values from `start` to `end`.\n2. We implement a recursive function `allPossibleBST` which takes the starting range of node values `start`, ending range `end`, and `memo` as parameters. It returns a list of `TreeNode` corresponding to all the BSTs that can be formed with this range of node values. We call `allPossibleBST(1, n, memo)` and perform the following:\n    - We declare a list of `TreeNode` called `res` to store the list of root nodes of all possible BSTs.\n    - If `start > end`, we push `null` to `res` and return it.\n    - If we already have solved this subproblem, i.e., `memo` contains the pair `(start, end)`, we return `memo[(start, end)]`.\n    - Select the root node value from `i = start` to `end` incrementing `i` by `1` after each iteration. We recursively call `leftSubtrees = llPossibleBST(start, i - 1, memo)` and `rightSubTrees = allPossibleBST(i + 1, end, memo)`. We iterate over all pairs between `leftSubtrees` and `rightSubTrees` and create a new root with value `i` for each pair. We push `root` of the new formed BST into `res`.\n    - Set `memo[(start, end)] = res` and return `res`.\n\n#### Implementation#### Complexity Analysis\n\nNote, the time and space complexity of this problem is difficult to derive. In an interview, you should do your best to find an upper bound. The level of analysis here would not be expected in an interview.\n\nThe number of unique BSTs that can be formed with `n` nodes is $G(n)$ where $G(n)$ is the $n^{th}$ [Catalan number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalan_number). $G(n) = O(\\dfrac{4^{n}}{n^{1.5}})$.\n\n* Time complexity: $O(\\dfrac{4^n}{\\sqrt{n}})$.\n    - There are $G(n) = \\dfrac{4^n}{n^{1.5}}$ BSTs in our answer. Each of these BSTs has $n$ nodes, so it cost us $O(n)$ to build each one. This gives us a time complexity of $O(n \\cdot G(n)) = O(\\dfrac{4^n}{\\sqrt{n}})$.\n\n* Space complexity: $O(\\sum_{k=1}^{n}{[(n - k + 1) \\cdot  \\dfrac{4^k}{\\sqrt{k}}]})$.\n\n    We use some space for the recursion call stack, but the majority of the space used by the algorithm is storing the lists of BSTs in `memo`. Let's analyze how many nodes are stored in `memo`.\n\n    The number of nodes in a range `start, end` is `end - start + 1`. Let $k = \\text{end} - \\text{start} + 1$ represent this formula.\n\n    There are $n$ states `start, end` with one node, that is $k = 1$.\n\n    There are $n - 1$ states `start, end` with two nodes, that is $k = 2$.\n\n    There are $n - 2$ states `start, end` with three nodes, that is $k = 3$.\n\n    This continues until there is only one state with $n$ nodes (the original input). In general, a value of $k$ has $n - k + 1$ states.\n\n    For a given state with value $k$, there are $G(k) = \\dfrac{4^k}{k^{1.5}}$ BSTs. Each of these BSTs has $k$ nodes, and thus takes up $k \\cdot G(k) = \\dfrac{4^k}{\\sqrt{k}}$ space in `memo`.\n\n    A given value $k$ has $n - k + 1$ states and thus takes up $(n - k + 1) \\cdot  \\dfrac{4^k}{\\sqrt{k}}$ space. In our algorithm, $k$ ranges from $1$ to $n$.\n\n    The space complexity is the summation for all values of $k$:\n\n    $\\Large{\\sum_{k=1}^{n}{[(n - k + 1) \\cdot  \\dfrac{4^k}{\\sqrt{k}}]}}$\n\n    This is a difficult sum to compute and involves higher-level mathematics. Using a program like WolframAlpha, we find that the sum is equal to:\n\n    $4^{1 + n} \\cdot \\Phi(4, -0.5, 1 + n) - 4^{1 + n} \\cdot (1 + n) \\cdot \\Phi(4, 0.5, 1 + n) - \\text{Li}_{-0.5}(4) + \\text{Li}_{0.5}(4) + n \\cdot \\text{Li}_{0.5}(4)$\n\n    Where $\\Phi$ is the [Lerch transcendent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lerch_zeta_function) and $\\text{Li}_n(x)$ is the [polylogarithm function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polylogarithm). Needless to say, computing this sum by hand is not necessary in an interview. Even reaching the summation expression would likely impress any interviewer.\n\n---\n\n### Approach 2: Iterative Dynamic Programming\n\n#### Intuition\n\nWe used memoization in the preceding approach to store the answers to subproblems in order to solve a larger problem. We can also use a bottom-up approach to solve such problems without using recursion. We build answers to subproblems iteratively first, then use them to build answers to larger problems.\n\nWe create a 3D list `dp[n + 1][n + 1]` where `dp[i][j]` will store a list of all BSTs that have node values ranging from `i` to `j`. Note that `dp[i][j] = allPossibleBST(i, j)` from the previous approach.\n\nWhen `i = j`, the range contains only one node with value `i`. We push a single node with value `i` in the list `dp[i][i]` for all the values of `i` from `1` to `n`. This acts as the base case of our solution while we move in bottom to top manner.\n\nWe form the answer with a smaller number of nodes having consecutive node values and move on to form answers for a bigger number of nodes. We run an outer loop from `numberOfNodes = 2` to `numberOfNodes = n` incrementing `numberOfNodes` by `1` after each iteration. This loop controls the total number of nodes under consideration.\n\nWe further need to choose a node value we start with. Let's call it `start`. As we have `numberOfNodes` nodes under consideration with consecutive values, the maximum node value in such a BST would be `end = start + numberOfNodes - 1`. We will move `start` from `1` to `n - numberOfNodes + 1`.\n\nNow we have the `start` value and the `end` value, we can implement the same logic that we did in the `allPossibleBST` function from the previous approach. Lock a value `i`, find all left and right subtrees, and then iterate over each `left, right` pair and create a new root with value `i` for each pair.\n\nAs we move from bottom to top, we will have a list of all the root nodes for all BSTs for every range of node values with lesser nodes.\n\nLocking a value `i` as the root node, we can find all left subtrees in `dp[start][i - 1]` and all right subtrees in `dp[i + 1][end]`. If `i == start`, the left subtree would be empty. Similarly, if `i == end`, the right subtree would be empty. We can handle these cases separately.\n\nWe run an outer loop from `numberOfNodes = 2` to `n`. We run an inner loop that selects the starting node value. It runs from `start = 1` to `n - numberOfNodes + 1`. We define `end = start + numberOfNodes - 1`. We run a third nested loop that selects the root of the BSTs under consideration. It runs from `i = start` to `end`.\n\nWe then iterate over the both the lists of left and right subtrees. For each root node `l` of the left subtree and `r` of the right subtree, we create a new `root` node with value `i` and set the left and right child to `l` and `r` respectively to form all the BSTs with root node as `i`. We also push each BST into `dp[start][end]` to be used later to build answer for other `dp` states with larger number of nodes.\n\n#### Algorithm\n\n1. Create a 3D list `dp[n + 1][n + 1]` where `dp[i][j]` will store a list of root nodes for all possible BSTs using `j - i + 1` nodes with values from `i` to `j` nodes.\n2. We initialize each list `dp[i][i]` to a `TreeNode` having value `i` for `i = 0` to `n`.\n3. Iterate from `numberOfNodes = 2` till `numberOfNodes = n` incrementing `numberOfNodes` by `1` after each iteration. We start an inner loop from `start = 1` to `n - numberOfNodes + 1` incrementing `start` by `1`. We create an integer variable `end = start + numberOfNodes - 1` which stores the highest node value of the BSTs that will be formed. We run another loop from `i = start` to `end` to use all the permutations as the root node value. We perform the following in this loop:\n    - We create a list of `TreeNode` called `leftSubtrees` which will store all the BSTs that can be formed with node values from `start` to `i - 1`. If `i == start`, we just add `null` to `leftSubtrees`, else `leftSubtrees == dp[start][i - 1]`.\n    - Similarly, we create a list of `TreeNode` called `rightSubtrees` which will store all the BSTs that can be formed with node values from `i + 1` to `end`. If `i == end`, we just add `null` to `rightSubtrees`, else `rightSubtrees == dp[i + 1][end]`.\n    - We form a new BST by creating a new node which acts as a root node with value `i`. For each element `left` in `leftSubtrees` and `right` in `rightSubtrees`, we set `root.left = left` and `root.right = right`. Finally, we add `root` to `dp[start][end]`.\n4. Return `dp[1][n]`.\n\n#### Implementation#### Complexity Analysis\n\n* Time complexity: $O(\\dfrac{4^n}{\\sqrt{n}})$.\n    - The time complexity of this approach will be similar to the **time complexity** of the first approach because we are iterating over the same `dp` states in bottom-up manner as compared to the previous approach where we used top-down approach with memoization.\n\n* Space complexity: $O(\\sum_{k=1}^{n}{[(n - k + 1) \\cdot  \\dfrac{4^k}{\\sqrt{k}}]})$.\n    - The space complexity would also be the number of BSTs stored in the `dp` list which is equal to the number of BSTs stored in `memo` in the worst-case. Hence, we have the same space complexity as the first approach.\n\n---\n\n### Approach 3: Dynamic Programming with Space Optimization\n\n#### Intuition\n\nWe used a 3D list where we used `dp[start][end]` to store all the BSTs having `end - start + 1` nodes with range from `start` to `end`. Let's think if we can reduce the 3D `dp` list to a 2D list.\n\nIf we compare all the BSTs that can be created from a set of consecutive values from `start` to `end` to those that can be created with the same number of nodes from a set of values starting at `1` and ending at `end - start + 1`, we will find that **the structure of all the BSTs created with the above two ranges would be identical**. The only difference is an offset of `start - 1` in the node values.\n\nHere's a visual representation of BSTs with 3 nodes from range `[1, 3]` and all BSTs with range `[4, 6]`:\n\n![img](../Figures/95/95-2.png)\n\nWe can see the structure of all the BSTs created with the above two ranges are identical.\n\nSo, we can just store the BSTs for all the ranges starting from `1` and add the offset to convert them to required ranges.\n\nWe create a 2D list `dp[n + 1]` where `dp[i]` will store a list of all BSTs with `i` nodes having values from `1` to `i`. `dp[n]` would be the answer to the problem. Similar to the above approach, we will move in bottom to top manner.\n\nWe push a `null` node (empty tree) to `dp[0]` which acts as the base case.\n\nTo get the list of root nodes for all possible BSTs with `numberOfNodes` nodes, we would split the `numberOfNodes` nodes with `i - 1` nodes with values `1` to `i - 1` in the left subtree, a root node with value `i` and the remaining `numberOfNodes - i` nodes with values `i + 1` to `numberOfNodes` in the right subtree where `1 <= i <= numberOfNodes`. Note that we do not need the starting of the range here, unlike the previous approach. It is always `1`. \n\nAs we are executing in bottom-up manner and figuring out the answer for `numberOfNodes` nodes, we will already have the list of root nodes for all BSTs with `i - 1` and `numberOfNodes - i` nodes (for all values of `i = 1` to `numberOfNodes`).\n\nHowever, you may realize that `dp[i - 1]` will give all the BSTs having values from `1` to `i - 1` which is exactly what we want but `dp[numberOfNodes - i]` will give all the BSTs having values from `1` to `numberOfNodes - i` which isn't what we want. We want the right subtree to have `numberOfNodes - i` nodes but the range of nodes should be from `i + 1` to `numberOfNodes`. If we add the offset `(i + 1) - 1 = i` to all the nodes, it would solve this as we would now have trees with `numberOfNodes - i` nodes from values `i + 1` to `numberOfNodes`. Let us form the BSTs now.\n\nSimilar to the previous approach, we create a new instance of `TreeNode` called `root` with the value `i`. We set the left child of `root` to an element in `dp[i - 1]`.\n\nNow, let's set the right child of `root`. We know every element in `dp[numberOfNodes - i]` is a root node that stores a BST with `numberOfNodes - 1` nodes having values from `1` to `numberOfNodes - i`. To set the right child of `root`, we create a new tree exactly similar to the tree stored by an element of `dp[numberOfNodes - i]` but increment all the node values of the new tree by `i`. We then set the right child of `root` to this newer tree.\n\nThe required tree with `i` offset can be created by using a recursive function `clone` in which we pass a `TreeNode node` which corresponds to an element in `dp[numberOfNodes - i]` and an integer `offset`. We create a new `TreeNode clonedNode` with value `node.val + offset`. We then recursively set the left and the right child of `clonedNode` by performing `clonedNode.left = clone(node.left, offset)` and `clonedNode.right = clone(node.right, offset)`. Finally, return `clonedNode`.\n\nIt is important to note that we are creating new trees to set the right child of `root` to preserve the original trees as it might be used directly (as `dp[i - 1]`) in some other iteration of `i` and `numberOfNodes`.\n\n#### Algorithm\n\n1. Create a list `dp[n + 1]` where `dp[i]` will store a list of root nodes for all possible BSTs using `i` nodes. We initialize each list `dp[i]` to an empty list for `i = 0` to `n`.\n2. We push a `null` node (empty tree) into `dp[0]` because with `n = 0` we can't have any BST. This forms the base case.\n3. Iterate from `numberOfNodes = 1` till `numberOfNodes = n` incrementing `numberOfNodes` by `1` after each iteration. We start an inner loop from `i = 1` to `numberOfNodes` incrementing `i` by `1`. We perform the following in this loop:\n    - Create a variable `j = numberOfNodes - i - 1`. It presents the number of nodes in the right subtree under consideration.\n    - We can form a new BST by creating a new node which acts as a root node with value `i`. We assign its left child to any element in `dp[i]` and right child to a new tree where tree is similar to an element in `dp[j]` but all node values are incremented by `i`. As a result, we need two loops to iterate through the lists `dp[i]` and `dp[j]`. We create a new `root` node with value `i`. For each element `left` in `dp[i]` and `right` in `dp[j]`, we set `root.left = left` and `root.right = clone(right, i)`. Finally, we add `root` to `dp[numberOfNodes]`.\n4. Return `dp[n]`.\n\n#### Implementation#### Complexity Analysis\n\n* Time complexity: $O(\\dfrac{4^n}{\\sqrt{n}})$.\n    - In this approach we are not storing all the BSTs with all the ranges. We are just storing BSTs starting from range `1`. However, we are creating all the BSTs for all the ranges from `[start, end]` (for `1 <= start, end  <= 1`) using the `clone` method by iterating over the BSTs starting with range `1`.\n    - As a result, the time complexity should be similar to the previous approach as we are generating the same number of BSTs.\n\n* Space complexity: $O(\\sum_{k=1}^{n}\\dfrac{4^k}{{\\sqrt{k}}})$.\n    - For any state `dp[k]`, we are storing all the BSTs that can be formed with $k$ nodes. We know there are $G(k)$ BSTs that can be formed with $k$ nodes. As we have $1$ to $n$ states, the total space consumed would be $O(\\sum_{k=1}^{n} k \\cdot G(k))$ = $O(\\sum_{k=1}^{n}\\dfrac{4^k}{{\\sqrt{k}}})$."
