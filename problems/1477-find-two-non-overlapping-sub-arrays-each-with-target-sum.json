  "description": "You are given an array of integers arr and an integer target.\nYou have to find two non-overlapping sub-arrays of arr each with a sum equal target. There can be multiple answers so you have to find an answer where the sum of the lengths of the two sub-arrays is minimum.\nReturn the minimum sum of the lengths of the two required sub-arrays, or return -1 if you cannot find such two sub-arrays.\nExample 1:\nExample 2:\nExample 3:\nConstraints:",

    "The answer we are searching for is min(prefix[i] + suffix[i]) for all values of i from 0 to n-1 where n == arr.length.",
    "If you are still stuck with how to build prefix and suffix, you can store for each index i the length of the sub-array starts at i and has sum = k or infinity otherwise, and you can use it to build both prefix and suffix."
