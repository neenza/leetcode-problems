We count this string.\n- \"amazing\" appears exactly once in each of the two arrays. We count this string.\n- \"is\" appears in each of the two arrays, but there are 2 occurrences of it in words1. We do not count this string.\n- \"as\" appears once in words1, but does not appear in words2. We do not count this string.\nThus, there are 2 strings that appear exactly once in each of the two arrays.",
