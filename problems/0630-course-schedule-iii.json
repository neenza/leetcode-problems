You are given an array courses where courses[i] = [durationi, lastDayi] indicate that the ith course should be taken continuously for durationi days and must be finished before or on lastDayi.\nYou will start on the 1st day and you cannot take two or more courses simultaneously.\nReturn the maximum number of courses that you can take.\nExample 1:\nExample 2:\nExample 3:\nConstraints:",
