The _letter-logs_ should be prioritized above all _digit-logs_.\n\n* 2). Among the _letter-logs_, we should further sort them firstly based on their **contents**, and then on their **identifiers** if the contents are identical.\n\n* 3). Among the _digit-logs_, they should remain in the same order as they are in the collection.\n\nOne can then go ahead and implement the comparator based on the above rules. Here is an example.**Stable Sort**\n\nOne might notice that in the above implementation one can find the logic that corresponds each of the rules, except the **Rule (3)**.\n\nIndeed, we did not do anything explicitly to ensure the order imposed by the Rule (3).\n\nThe short answer is that the Rule (3) is ensured _implicitly_ by an important property of sorting algorithms, called **[stability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorting_algorithm#Stability)**.\n\n>It is stated as \"stable sorting algorithms sort equal elements in the same order that they appear in the input.\"\n\nNot all sort algorithms are _stable_, _e.g._ **_merge sort_** is stable.\n\nThe `Arrays.sort()` interface that we used is stable, as one can find in the [specification](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/util/Arrays.html).\n\nTherefore, the Rule (3) is implicitly respected thanks to the stability of the sorting algorithm that we used.\n\n**Complexity Analysis**\n\nLet $$N$$ be the number of logs in the list and\n$$M$$ be the maximum length of a single log. \n\n- Time Complexity: $$\\mathcal{O}(M \\cdot N \\cdot \\log N)$$\n\n    - First of all, the time complexity of the `Arrays.sort()` is $$\\mathcal{O}(N \\cdot \\log N)$$, as stated in the [API specification](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Arrays.html#sort-byte:A-), which is to say that the `compare()` function would be invoked $$\\mathcal{O}(N \\cdot \\log N)$$ times.\n\n    - For each invocation of the `compare()` function, it could take up to $$\\mathcal{O}(M)$$ time, since we compare the contents of the logs.\n\n    - Therefore, the overall time complexity of the algorithm is $$\\mathcal{O}(M \\cdot N \\cdot \\log N)$$.\n\n\n- Space Complexity: $$\\mathcal{O}(M \\cdot \\log N)$$\n\n    - For each invocation of the `compare()` function, we would need up to $$\\mathcal{O}(M)$$ space to hold the parsed logs.\n\n    - In addition, since the implementation of `Arrays.sort()` is based on quicksort algorithm whose space complexity is $$\\mathcal{O}(\\log n)$$, assuming that the space for each element is $$\\mathcal{O}(1)$$).\n    Since each log could be of $$\\mathcal{O}(M)$$ space, we would need $$\\mathcal{O}(M \\cdot \\log N)$$ space to hold the intermediate values for sorting.\n\n    - In total, the overall space complexity of the algorithm is $$\\mathcal{O}(M + M \\cdot \\log N) = \\mathcal{O}(M \\cdot \\log N)$$.\n\n\n---\n### Approach 2: Sorting by Keys\n\n**Intuition**\n\nRather than defining pairwise relationships among all elements in a collection, the order of the elements can also be defined with **sorting keys**.\n\nTo illustrate the idea, let us first define a `Student` object as follows, which has three properties: _name_, _grade_, _age_.\n\n```python\nclass Student:\n    def __init__(self, name, grade, age):\n        self.name = name\n        self.grade = grade\n        self.age = age\n\nstudent_objects = [\n    Student('john', 'A', 15),\n    Student('jane', 'B', 12),\n    Student('dave', 'B', 10),\n]\n```\n\nNow, if we are asked to sort the list of students by _age_ in ascending order, we could simply use the `age` property of each student as the sorting key, as follows:\n\n```python\n>>> sorted(student_objects, key=lambda student: student.age)\n[('dave', 'B', 10), ('jane', 'B', 12), ('john', 'A', 15)]\n```\n\n>Furthermore, the key could be a tuple of multiple keys, _i.e._ `tuple(key_1, key_2, ... key_n)`.\n\nIf two elements have the same value on `key_1`, the comparison will carry on for the following keys, _i.e._ `key_2 ... key_n`.\n\nAs a result, if we are asked to sort the students first by the _grade_, then by the _age_, we can simply return the compound key `(stduent.grade, student.age)`, as follows:\n\n```python\n>>> sorted(student_objects, key=lambda student: (student.grade, student.age))\n[('john', 'A', 15), ('dave', 'B', 10), ('jane', 'B', 12)]\n```\n\n**Algorithm**\n\nGiven the above intuition, it should be clear that all we need is to _translate_ the rules we defined before into a tuple of keys.\n\nAs a reminder, here are a list of the rules that we defined before, concerning the order of logs:\n\n* 1). The _letter-logs_ should be prioritized above all _digit-logs_.\n\n* 2). Among the _letter-logs_, we should further sort them based on firstly on their **contents**, and then on their **identifiers** if the contents are identical.\n\n* 3). Among the _digit-logs_, they should remain in the same order as they are in the collection.\n\nTo ensure the above order, we could define a tuple of 3 keys, `(key_1, key_2, key_3)`, as follows:\n\n- `key_1`: this key serves as a indicator for the type of logs. For the _letter-logs_, we could assign its `key_1` with `0`, and for the _digit-logs_, we assign its `key_1` with `1`.\nAs we can see, thanks to the assigned values, the _letter-logs_ would take the priority above the _digit-logs_.\n\n- `key_2`: for this key, we use the **_content_** of the _letter-logs_ as its value, so that among the _letter-logs_, they would be further ordered based on their content, as required in the Rule (2).\n\n- `key_3`: similarly with the `key_2`, this key serves to further order the _letter-logs_. We will use the **_identifier_** of the _letter-logs_ as its value, so that for the _letter-logs_ with the same content, we could further sort the logs based on its identifier, as required in the Rule (2).\n\n**Note:** for the _digit-logs_, we don't need the `key_2` and `key_3`.\nWe can simply assign the `None` value to these two keys. As a result, the key value for all the _digit-logs_ would be `(1, None, None)`.\n\nFinally, thanks to the **stability** of sorting algorithms, the elements with the same key value would remain the same order as in the original input.\nTherefore, the Rule (3) is ensured.**Complexity Analysis**\n\n\nLet $$N$$ be the number of logs in the list and\n$$M$$ be the maximum length of a single log. \n\n- Time Complexity: $$\\mathcal{O}(M \\cdot N \\cdot \\log N)$$\n\n    - The `sorted()` in Python is implemented with the [Timsort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timsort) algorithm whose time complexity is $$\\mathcal{O}(N \\cdot \\log N)$$.\n\n    - Since the keys of the elements are basically the logs itself, the comparison between two keys can take up to $$\\mathcal{O}(M)$$ time.\n\n    - Therefore, the overall time complexity of the algorithm is $$\\mathcal{O}(M \\cdot N \\cdot \\log N)$$.\n\n\n- Space Complexity: $$\\mathcal{O}(M \\cdot N)$$\n\n    - First, we need $$\\mathcal{O}(M \\cdot N)$$ space to keep the keys for the log.\n\n    - In addition, the worst space complexity of the [Timsort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timsort) algorithm is $$\\mathcal{O}(N)$$, assuming that the space for each element is $$\\mathcal{O}(1)$$.\n    Hence we would need $$\\mathcal{O}(M \\cdot N)$$ space to hold the intermediate values for sorting.\n\n    - In total, the overall space complexity of the algorithm is $$\\mathcal{O}(M \\cdot N + M \\cdot N) = \\mathcal{O}(M \\cdot N)$$.\n\n\n---"
