  "description": "You are given a 2D integer array grid of size m x n, where each cell contains a positive integer.\nA cornered path is defined as a set of adjacent cells with at most one turn. More specifically, the path should exclusively move either horizontally or vertically up to the turn (if there is one), without returning to a previously visited cell. After the turn, the path will then move exclusively in the alternate direction: move vertically if it moved horizontally, and vice versa, also without returning to a previously visited cell.\nThe product of a path is defined as the product of all the values in the path.\nReturn the maximum number of trailing zeros in the product of a cornered path found in grid.\nNote:\nExample 1:\nExample 2:\nConstraints:",

    "What actually tells us the trailing zeros of the product of a path?",
    "It is the sum of the exponents of 2 and sum of the exponents of 5 of the prime factorizations of the numbers on that path. The smaller of the two is the answer for that path.",
    "We can then treat each cell as the elbow point and calculate the largest minimum (sum of 2 exponents, sum of 5 exponents) from the combination of top-left, top-right, bottom-left and bottom-right.",
    "To do this efficiently, we should use the prefix sum technique."
