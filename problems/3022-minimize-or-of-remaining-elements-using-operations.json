  "description": "You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums and an integer k.\nIn one operation, you can pick any index i of nums such that 0 <= i < nums.length - 1 and replace nums[i] and nums[i + 1] with a single occurrence of nums[i] & nums[i + 1], where & represents the bitwise AND operator.\nReturn the minimum possible value of the bitwise OR of the remaining elements of nums after applying at most k operations.\nExample 1:\nExample 2:\nExample 3:\nConstraints:",
