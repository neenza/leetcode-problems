  "description": "Alice and Bob want to water n plants in their garden. The plants are arranged in a row and are labeled from 0 to n - 1 from left to right where the ith plant is located at x = i.\nEach plant needs a specific amount of water. Alice and Bob have a watering can each, initially full. They water the plants in the following way:\nGiven a 0-indexed integer array plants of n integers, where plants[i] is the amount of water the ith plant needs, and two integers capacityA and capacityB representing the capacities of Alice's and Bob's watering cans respectively, return the number of times they have to refill to water all the plants.\nExample 1:\nExample 2:\nExample 3:\nConstraints:",

Bob does not have enough water for plant 2, so he refills his can then waters it.\nSo, the total number of times they have to refill to water all the plants is 0 + 0 + 1 + 0 = 1.",
