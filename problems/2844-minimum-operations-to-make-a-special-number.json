  "description": "You are given a 0-indexed string num representing a non-negative integer.\nIn one operation, you can pick any digit of num and delete it. Note that if you delete all the digits of num, num becomes 0.\nReturn the minimum number of operations required to make num special.\nAn integer x is considered special if it is divisible by 25.\nExample 1:\nExample 2:\nExample 3:\nConstraints:",
