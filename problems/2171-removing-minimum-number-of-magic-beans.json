  "description": "You are given an array of positive integers beans, where each integer represents the number of magic beans found in a particular magic bag.\nRemove any number of beans (possibly none) from each bag such that the number of beans in each remaining non-empty bag (still containing at least one bean) is equal. Once a bean has been removed from a bag, you are not allowed to return it to any of the bags.\nReturn the minimum number of magic beans that you have to remove.\nExample 1:\nExample 2:\nConstraints:",
