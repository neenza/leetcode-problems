  "description": "You are given a 0-indexed array of strings words. Each string consists of lowercase English letters only. No letter occurs more than once in any string of words.\nTwo strings s1 and s2 are said to be connected if the set of letters of s2 can be obtained from the set of letters of s1 by any one of the following operations:\nThe array words can be divided into one or more non-intersecting groups. A string belongs to a group if any one of the following is true:\nNote that the strings in words should be grouped in such a manner that a string belonging to a group cannot be connected to a string present in any other group. It can be proved that such an arrangement is always unique.\nReturn an array ans of size 2 where:\nExample 1:\nExample 2:\nConstraints:",

So words[0] is connected to words[1] and words[2].\n- words[1] can be used to obtain words[0] (by replacing 'b' with 'a'), and words[2] (by adding 'a'). So words[1] is connected to words[0] and words[2].\n- words[2] can be used to obtain words[0] (by deleting 'b'), and words[1] (by deleting 'a'). So words[2] is connected to words[0] and words[1].\n- words[3] is not connected to any string in words.\nThus, words can be divided into 2 groups [\"a\",\"b\",\"ab\"] and [\"cde\"]. The size of the largest group is 3.",
