  "description": "There is a special typewriter with lowercase English letters 'a' to 'z' arranged in a circle with a pointer. A character can only be typed if the pointer is pointing to that character. The pointer is initially pointing to the character 'a'.\nEach second, you may perform one of the following operations:\nGiven a string word, return the minimum number of seconds to type out the characters in word.\nExample 1:\nExample 2:\nExample 3:\nConstraints:",
