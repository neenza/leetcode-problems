  "description": "You are given the logs for users' actions on LeetCode, and an integer k. The logs are represented by a 2D integer array logs where each logs[i] = [IDi, timei] indicates that the user with IDi performed an action at the minute timei.\nMultiple users can perform actions simultaneously, and a single user can perform multiple actions in the same minute.\nThe user active minutes (UAM) for a given user is defined as the number of unique minutes in which the user performed an action on LeetCode. A minute can only be counted once, even if multiple actions occur during it.\nYou are to calculate a 1-indexed array answer of size k such that, for each j (1 <= j <= k), answer[j] is the number of users whose UAM equals j.\nReturn the array answer as described above.\nExample 1:\nExample 2:\nConstraints:",

Hence, they have a UAM of 2 (minute 5 is only counted once).\nThe user with ID=1 performed actions at minutes 2 and 3. Hence, they have a UAM of 2.\nSince both users have a UAM of 2, answer[2] is 2, and the remaining answer[j] values are 0.",
