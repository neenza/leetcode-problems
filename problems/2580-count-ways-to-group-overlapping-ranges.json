  "description": "You are given a 2D integer array ranges where ranges[i] = [starti, endi] denotes that all integers between starti and endi (both inclusive) are contained in the ith range.\nYou are to split ranges into two (possibly empty) groups such that:\nTwo ranges are said to be overlappingÂ if there exists at least one integer that is present in both ranges.\nReturn the total number of ways to split ranges into two groups. Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo 109 + 7.\nExample 1:\nExample 2:\nConstraints:",

So, they must also be in the same group. \nThus, there are four possible ways to group them:\n- All the ranges in group 1.\n- All the ranges in group 2.\n- Ranges [1,3], [2,5], and [4,8] in group 1 and [10,20] in group 2.\n- Ranges [1,3], [2,5], and [4,8] in group 2 and [10,20] in group 1.",
