  "solution": "[TOC]\n\n## Solution\n--- \n### Overview\n\nIn this problem, we have a DataFrame named `students` that contains student data. However, the grades are stored as floats instead of integers. The goal is to change the grade type from floats to integers.\n\n**Key Concepts**:\n\n1. **DataFrame:** a 2D table-like structure, similar to a spreadsheet or SQL table. Each row represents an individual record and each column represents a different attribute. It is size-mutable and designed to handle a mix of different types of data. \n2. **`astype` Function:** The `astype` function is used to cast a pandas object to a specified dtype (data type). `astype` can be used to cast a pandas object to any dtype. The `astype` function does not modify the original DataFrame in place. Instead, it returns a new DataFrame with the specified data type changes. If you want to reflect changes in the original DataFrame, you need to reassign the result back to it or use the `copy` parameter accordingly. The function’s syntax is:\n\n```python\nDataFrame.astype(dtype, copy=True, errors='raise')\n```\n\nWhere:\n\n- `dtype`: It's a data type, or dict of column name -> data type. \n- `copy`: By default, astype always returns a newly allocated object. If `copy` is set to `False`, a new object will only be created if the old object cannot be casted to the required type.\n- `errors`: Controls the raising of exceptions on invalid data for the provided dtype. By default, `raise` is set which means exceptions will be raised.\n\nSo in our case we want to cast the `grade` column from float to int and we can do so with the following line:\n```python\nstudents = students.astype({'grade': int})\n```\n\n### Intuition\n\n**Visualization of `astype` function**\n\n![fig](../Figures/3313/3313-1.png)\n\nIn the provided solution:\n```python\nstudents = students.astype({'grade': int})\n```\nThis line is casting the `grade` column from float to int.\n\nLet’s go step by step through the provided solution:\n\n1. **Importing pandas**:\n   ```python\n   import pandas as pd\n   ```\n   This line imports the pandas library and gives it an alias name `pd`. The pandas library provides fast, flexible, and expressive data structures designed to work with structured (tabular, multidimensional, potentially heterogeneous) data.\n\n2. **Function Definition**:\n   ```python\n   def changeDatatype(students: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:\n   ```\n   This line defines a function named `changeDatatype` that takes in a DataFrame `students` as an argument and returns a DataFrame.\n\n3. **Changing Data Type of a Column**:\n   ```python\n   students = students.astype({'grade': int})\n   ```\n   This line of code is the heart of the solution. It changes the data type of the `grade` column to integer using the `astype` function. The `{'grade': int}` is a dictionary where the key is the column name and the value is the desired data type.\n\n4. **Return Statement**:\n   ```python\n   return students\n   ```\n   This line returns the modified DataFrame.\n\n**Using the Solution**\n\nWhen you pass this DataFrame to the function:student_idnameagegrade1Ava673.02Kate1587.0It will return:student_idnameagegrade1Ava6732Kate1587### Implementation"
