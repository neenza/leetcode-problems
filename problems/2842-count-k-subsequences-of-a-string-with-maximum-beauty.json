  "description": "You are given a string s and an integer k.\nA k-subsequence is a subsequence of s, having length k, and all its characters are unique, i.e., every character occurs once.\nLet f(c) denote the number of times the character c occurs in s.\nThe beauty of a k-subsequence is the sum of f(c) for every character c in the k-subsequence.\nFor example, consider s = \"abbbdd\" and k = 2:\nReturn an integer denoting the number of k-subsequences whose beauty is the maximum among all k-subsequences. Since the answer may be too large, return it modulo 109 + 7.\nA subsequence of a string is a new string formed from the original string by deleting some (possibly none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters.\nNotes\nExample 1:\nExample 2:\nConstraints:",

    "Since every character appears once in a k-subsequence, we can solve the following problem first: Find the total number of ways to select <code>k</code> characters such that the sum of their frequencies is maximum.",
    "An obvious case to eliminate is if <code>k</code> is greater than the number of distinct characters in <code>s</code>, then the answer is <code>0</code>.",
    "We are now interested in the top frequencies among the characters. Using a map data structure, let <code>cnt[x]</code> denote the number of characters that have a frequency of <code>x</code>.",
    "Starting from the maximum value <code>x</code> in <code>cnt</code>. Let <code>i = min(k, cnt[x])</code> we add to our result <code> <sup>cnt[x]</sup>C<sub>i</sub> * x<sup>i</sup></code> representing the number of ways to select <code>i</code> characters from all characters with frequency <code>x</code>, multiplied by the number of ways to choose each individual character. Subtract <code>i</code> from <code>k</code> and continue downwards to the next maximum value.",
