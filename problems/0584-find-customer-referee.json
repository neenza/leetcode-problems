  "solution": "[TOC]\n\n## Solution\n---\n### Approach: Using `<>`(`!=`) and `IS NULL` [Accepted]\n\n**Intuition**\n\nSome people come out the following solution by intuition.\n```sql\nSELECT name FROM customer WHERE referee_Id <> 2;\n```\n\nHowever, this query will only return one result:Zack although there are 4 customers not referred by Jane (including Jane herself). All the customers who were referred by nobody at all (`NULL` value in the referee_id column) don’t show up. But why?\n\n**Algorithm**\n\nMySQL uses three-valued logic -- TRUE, FALSE and UNKNOWN. Anything compared to NULL evaluates to the third value: UNKNOWN. That “anything” includes NULL itself! That’s why MySQL provides the `IS NULL` and `IS NOT NULL` operators to specifically check for NULL.\n\nThus, one more condition 'referee_id IS NULL' should be added to the WHERE clause as below.\n\n**MySQL**\n\n```sql\nSELECT name FROM customer WHERE referee_id <> 2 OR referee_id IS NULL;\n```\nor\n```mysql\nSELECT name FROM customer WHERE referee_id != 2 OR referee_id IS NULL;\n```\n\n**Tips**\n\nThe following solution is also wrong for the same reason as mentioned above. The key is to always use `IS NULL` or `IS NOT NULL` operators to specifically check for NULL value.\n\n```sql\nSELECT name FROM customer WHERE referee_id = NULL OR referee_id <> 2;\n```"
