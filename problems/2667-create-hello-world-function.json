  "solution": "[TOC]\n\n## Solution\n\n--- \n\n### Overview\n\nThis question is intended as an introduction to JavaScript functions. This editorial will cover their syntax and topics like ***closures*** and ***higher-order functions***.\n\nIf you are new to JavaScript, it is recommended you follow along with the code examples. You can do this by pasting code into the LeetCode [playground](https://leetcode.com/playground/).\n\nAn awesome thing about JavaScript is your browser has a built-in execution environment. You can read more on how to execute code within your browser (and view a website's code) [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/Tools_and_setup/What_are_browser_developer_tools).\n\n#### Function Syntax \n\nIn JavaScript, there are two main ways to declare a function. One of which is to use the `function` keyword.\n\n##### Basic Syntax\n\nThe syntax is:\n\n```js\nfunction f(a, b) {\n    const sum = a + b;\n    return sum;\n}\nconsole.log(f(3, 4)); // 7\n```\nIn this example, `f` is the name of the function. `(a, b)` are the arguments. You can write any logic in the body and finally `return` a result. You are allowed to return nothing, and it will instead implicitly return `undefined`.\n\n##### Anonymous Function \n\nYou can optionally exclude the name of the function after the `function` keyword.\n```js\nvar f = function(a, b) {\n    const sum = a + b;\n    return sum;\n}\nconsole.log(f(3, 4)); // 7\n```\n\n##### Immediately Invoked Function Expression (IIFE)\nYou can create a function and immediately execute it in Javascript.\n```js\nconst result = (function(a, b) {\n    const sum = a + b;\n    return sum;\n})(3, 4);\nconsole.log(result); // 7\n```\nWhy would you write code like this? It gives you the opportunity to ***encapsulate*** a variable within a new ***scope***. For example, another developer can immediately see that `sum` can't be used anywhere outside the function body.\n\n##### Functions Within Functions\nA powerful feature of JavaScript is you can actually create functions within other functions and even return them!\n\n```js\nfunction createFunction() {\n    function f(a, b) {\n        const sum = a + b;\n        return sum;\n    }\n    return f;\n}\nconst f = createFunction();\nconsole.log(f(3, 4)); // 7\n```\nIn this example, `createFunction()` returns a new function. Then that function can be used as normal.\n\n##### Function Hoisting\nJavaScript has a feature called ***hoisting*** where a function can sometimes be used before it is initialized. You can only do this if you declare functions with the `function` syntax.\n\n```js\nfunction createFunction() {\n    return f;\n    function f(a, b) {\n        const sum = a + b;\n        return sum;\n    }\n}\nconst f = createFunction();\nconsole.log(f(3, 4)); // 7\n```\nIn this example, the function is returned before it is initialized. Although it is valid syntax, it is sometimes considered bad practice as it can reduce readability.\n\n##### Closures\n\nAn important topic in JavaScript is the concept of ***closures***. When a function is created, it has access to a reference to all the variables declared around it, also known as it's ***lexical environment***. The combination of the function and its enviroment is called a ***closure***. This is a powerful and often used feature of the language.\n\n```js\nfunction createAdder(a) {\n    function f(b) {\n        const sum = a + b;\n        return sum;\n    }\n    return f;\n}\nconst f = createAdder(3);\nconsole.log(f(4)); // 7\n```\nIn this example, `createAdder` passes the first parameter `a` and the inner function has access to it. This way, `createAdder` serves as a factory of new functions, with each returned function having different behavior.\n\n#### Arrow Syntax\n\nThe other common way to declare functions is with arrow syntax. In fact, on many projects, it is the preferred syntax.\n\n##### Basic Syntax\n\n```js\nconst f = (a, b) => {\n    const sum = a + b;\n    return sum;\n};\nconsole.log(f(3, 4)); // 7\n```\nIn this example, `f` is the name of the function. `(a, b)` are the arguments. You can write any logic in the body and finally `return` a result. You are allowed to return nothing, and it will instead implicitly return `undefined`.\n\n##### Omit Return\n\nIf you can write the code in a single line, you can omit the `return` keyword. This can result in very short code.\n\n```js\nconst f = (a, b) => a + b;\nconsole.log(f(3, 4)); // 7\n```\n\n##### Differences\n\nThere are 3 major differences between arrow syntax and function syntax.\n\n1. More minimalistic syntax. This is especially true for anonymous functions and single-line functions. For this reason, this way is generally preferred when passing short anonymous functions to other functions.\n2. No automatic hoisting. You are only allowed to use the function after it was declared. This is generally considered a good thing for readability.\n3. Can't be bound to `this`, `super`, and `arguments` or be used as a constructor. These are all complex topics in themselves but the basic takeaway should be that arrow functions are simpler in their feature set. You can read more about these differences [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Arrow_functions).\n\nThe choice of arrow syntax versus function syntax is primarily down to preference and your project's stylistic standards.\n\n#### Rest Arguments\n\nYou can use ***rest*** syntax to access all the passed arguments as an array. This isn't necessary for this problem, but it will be a critical concept for many problems. You can read more about `...` syntax [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Spread_syntax).\n\n##### Basic Syntax\n\nThe syntax is:\n\n```js\nfunction f(...args) {\n    const sum = args[0] + args[1];\n    return sum;\n}\nconsole.log(f(3, 4)); // 7\n```\n\nIn this example the variable `args` is `[3, 4]`.\n\n##### Why\n\nIt may not be immediately obvious why you would use this syntax because you can always just pass an array and get the same result.\n\nThe primary use-case is for creating generic factory functions that accept any function as input and return a new version of the function with some specific modification.\n\nBy the way, a function that accepts a function and/or returns a function is called a ***higher-order function***, and they are very common in JavaScript.\n\nFor example, you can create a logged function factory:\n```js\nfunction log(inputFunction) {\n    return function(...args) {\n        console.log(\"Input\", args);\n        const result = inputFunction(...args);\n        console.log(\"Output\", result);\n        return result;\n    }\n}\nconst f = log((a, b) => a + b);\nf(1, 2); // Logs: Input [1, 2] Output 3\n```\n\n---\n\n### Solutions to Problem\n\nNow let's apply these different ways of writing JavaScript functions to solve this problem.\n\n#### Function Syntax#### Arrow Syntax#### Arrow Syntax + Rest Arguments"
