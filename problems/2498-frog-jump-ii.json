  "description": "You are given a 0-indexed integer array stones sorted in strictly increasing order representing the positions of stones in a river.\nA frog, initially on the first stone, wants to travel to the last stone and then return to the first stone. However, it can jump to any stone at most once.\nThe length of a jump is the absolute difference between the position of the stone the frog is currently on and the position of the stone to which the frog jumps.\nThe cost of a path is the maximum length of a jump among all jumps in the path.\nReturn the minimum cost of a path for the frog.\nExample 1:\nExample 2:\nConstraints:",

The cost for the path will be max(9, 9) = 9.\nIt can be shown that this is the minimum achievable cost.",
