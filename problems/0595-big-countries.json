Thus the next step is returning the three required columns with the relative order as: `name`, `population`, and `area`.\n\n```python\n    df = df[['name', 'population', 'area']]\n```namepopulationareaAfghanistan25500100652230Algeria371000002381741#### Implementation---\n\n## Database### Approach: Filtering rows using `WHERE`#### Algorithm\n\nTo determine whether a country is considered `big`, there are two conditions to verify, as stated in the description:\n\n- The country must have an area of at least three million square kilometers, denoted as `area >= 3,000,000`.\n\n- The population of the country should be a minimum of twenty-five million, expressed as `population >= 25,000,000`.\n\n\n```sql\nSELECT \n    * \nFROM \n    world \nWHERE \n    area >= 3000000 \n    OR population >= 25000000\n```Noting that we need to return three columns according to the requirements of the problem.
