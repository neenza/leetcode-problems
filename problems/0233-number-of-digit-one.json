Hence, we need a way to find a pattern in the way $$'1'$$s (or for that matter any digit) appears in the numbers. We could then use the pattern to formulate the answer.\n\nConsider the $$1$$s in $$\\text{ones}$$ place , $$\\text{tens}$$ place, $$\\text{hundreds}$$ place and so on... An analysis\nhas been performed in the following figure.\n\n![Number of digit one](../Figures/233/number_of_digit_one.png){:width=\"800px\"}\n\n\nFrom the figure, we can see that from digit '1' at $$\\text{ones}$$ place repeat in group of 1 after interval of $$10$$. Similarly, '1' at $$\\text{tens}$$ place repeat in group of 10 after interval of $$100$$.\nThis can be formulated as $$(n/(i*10))*i$$.\n\nAlso, notice that if the digit at $$\\text{tens}$$ place is $$\\text{'1'}$$, then the number of terms with $$\\text{'1's}$$  is increased by $$x+1$$, if the number is say $$\\text{\"ab1x\"}$$. As if digits at $$\\text{tens}$$ place is greater than $$1$$, then all the $$10$$ occurances of numbers with $$'1'$$ at $$\\text{tens}$$ place have taken place, hence, we add $$10$$.\nThis is formluated as $${\\min(\\max((\\text{n mod (i*10)} )-i+1,0),i)}$$.\n\nLets take an example, say $$n= 1234$$.\n\nNo of $$\\text{'1'}$$ in $$\\text{ones}$$ place = $$1234/10$$(corresponding to 1,11,21,...1221) + $$\\min(4,1)$$(corresponding to 1231) =$$124$$\n\nNo of $$\\text{'1'}$$ in $$\\text{tens}$$ place = $$(1234/100)*10$$(corresponding to 10,11,12,...,110,111,...1919) +$$\\min(21,10)$$(corresponding to 1210,1211,...1219)=$$130$$\n\nNo of $$\\text{'1'}$$ in $$\\text{hundreds}$$ place = $$(1234/1000)*100$$(corresponding to 100,101,12,...,199) +$$\\min(135,100)$$(corresponding to 1100,1101...1199)=$$200$$\n\nNo of $$\\text{'1'}$$ in $$\\text{thousands}$$ place = $$(1234/10000)*10000$$ +$$\\min(235,1000)$$(corresponding to 1000,1001,...1234)=$$235$$\n\nTherefore, Total = $$124+130+200+235 = 689$$.\n\nHerein, one formula has been devised, but many other formulae can be devised for faster implementations, but the essence and complexity remains the same. The users are encouraged to try to devise their own version of solution using the mathematical concepts.\n\n**Algorithm**\n\n* Iterate over $$i$$ from $$1$$ to $$n$$ incrementing by $$10$$ each time:\n\n    - Add  $$(n/(i*10))*i$$ to $$\\text{countr}$$ representing the repetition of groups of $$i$$ sizes after each $$(i*10)$$ interval.\n\n    - Add $${\\min(\\max((\\text{n mod (i*10)} )-i+1,0),i)}$$ to $$\\text{countr}$$ representing the additional digits dependant on the digit in $$i$$th place as described in intuition.**Complexity analysis**\n\n* Time complexity: $$O(log_{10}(n))$$.\n\n  + No of iterations equal to the number of digits in n which is $$log_{10}(n)$$\n\n* Space complexity: $$O(1)$$ space required."
