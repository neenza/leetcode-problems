  "description": "You are given a string s, an integer k, a letter letter, and an integer repetition.\nReturn the lexicographically smallest subsequence of s of length k that has the letter letter appear at least repetition times. The test cases are generated so that the letter appears in s at least repetition times.\nA subsequence is a string that can be derived from another string by deleting some or no characters without changing the order of the remaining characters.\nA string a is lexicographically smaller than a string b if in the first position where a and b differ, string a has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in b.\nExample 1:\nExample 2:\nExample 3:\nConstraints:",
