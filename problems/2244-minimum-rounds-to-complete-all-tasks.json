In each round, you can complete either 2 or 3 tasks of the same difficulty level.\nReturn the minimum rounds required to complete all the tasks, or -1 if it is not possible to complete all the tasks.\nExample 1:\nExample 2:\nConstraints:\nNote: This question is the same as 2870: Minimum Number of Operations to Make Array Empty.",
